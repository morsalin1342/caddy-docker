This repository contains the build instructions for a customized [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) Docker image — a high-performance **reverse proxy** and **web server** with **automatic HTTPS** via Let's Encrypt. It includes the standard Caddy features plus a selection of commonly used plugins for DNS validation, caching, web application firewalling, rate limiting, and more.

The image is automatically built and published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/morsalin1342/caddy) via GitHub Actions.

## ✨ Why This Image?

| **DNS challenge** | Requires custom build | ✅ 6 providers built-in |
| **Production ready** | Needs custom build | ✅ Ready to deploy |

## Quick Start

To get started, you need a `Caddyfile` for your configuration.

```sh
docker run -d --name caddy \
    -p 80:80 \
    -p 443:443 \
    -p 443:443/udp \
    -v /path/to/your/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile:ro \
    -v caddy_data:/data \
    -v caddy_config:/config \
    morsalin1342/caddy:latest
```

### Persistent Data

This command uses Docker named volumes to persist important data:

*   **`caddy_data`**: Stores TLS certificates and other persistent data. Caddy will create this automatically.
*   **`caddy_config`**: Stores any JSON config changes made via the admin API.

## Configuration

Your primary method of configuration is by providing a `Caddyfile`. Mount your local `Caddyfile` to `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` inside the container as shown in the command above.

For more advanced use cases, you can use the [Caddy Admin API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/api).

## Versioning

This image is tagged with two schemes:

*   `morsalin1342/caddy:latest`: Always points to the most recently built image from the `master` branch.
*   `morsalin1342/caddy:<version>`: (e.g., `morsalin1342/caddy:2.11.4`) A specific version tag corresponding to the version of Caddy used in the build.

It is recommended to use a specific version tag in production environments for stability.

## Included Plugins

This image extends the official Caddy image with the following plugins:

*   **Web Application Firewall (Coraza)**: `github.com/corazawaf/coraza-caddy/v2`
    *   OWASP Coraza is ModSecurity/SecLang compatible. The OWASP Core Rule Set is
        compiled into the binary — use `load_owasp_crs` and the `@`-prefixed include
        paths, with no rule files to download or mount.
*   **IP Range Blocking (Defender)**: `pkg.jsn.cam/caddy-defender`
    *   Blocks, drops, or garbles requests from embedded IP range lists — AI crawlers
        (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity), cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure), VPN exits —
        plus your own CIDRs. Note the module path is the vanity import
        `pkg.jsn.cam/caddy-defender`, not the GitHub path.
*   **Rate Limiting**: `github.com/mholt/caddy-ratelimit`
    *   Sliding-window rate limiting with multiple zones, keyed on any request
        placeholder (client IP, host, header). Sets `Retry-After` automatically.
*   **Brotli Compression**: `github.com/dunglas/caddy-cbrotli`
*   **HTTP Caching (Souin)**: `github.com/darkweak/souin/plugins/caddy`
    *   Storage backends:
        *   `github.com/darkweak/storages/go-redis/caddy` (Redis)
        *   `github.com/darkweak/storages/otter/caddy` (in-memory)
        *   `github.com/darkweak/storages/simplefs/caddy` (file-based)
*   **DNS Providers for ACME TLS**:
    *   `github.com/caddy-dns/vultr`
    *   `github.com/caddy-dns/azure`
    *   `github.com/caddy-dns/googleclouddns`
    *   `github.com/caddy-dns/digitalocean`
    *   `github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare`
    *   `github.com/caddy-dns/route53`

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How do I add more plugins?**
A: Fork this repository and add your desired plugins to the `xcaddy build` command in the `Dockerfile`, then rebuild. Caddy plugins are Go modules compiled directly into the binary.

**Q: How do I use DNS challenge for wildcard certificates?**
A: All six DNS providers (Cloudflare, Route53, DigitalOcean, Vultr, Azure, Google Cloud DNS) are pre-compiled. Set the appropriate environment variables for your provider's API credentials and configure the `tls` directive in your `Caddyfile`.

**Q: How does caching work with this image?**
A: The Souin cache handler is pre-installed with three storage backends: `simplefs` (file-based, zero config), `go-redis` (distributed), and `otter` (in-memory). Configure caching in your `Caddyfile` via the `cache` directive.

**Q: How do I turn the WAF on?**
A: Add `order coraza_waf first` to your global options, then a `coraza_waf` block to
the site. `load_owasp_crs` is what makes the `@` paths resolvable — without it Caddy
fails at startup with `open @coraza.conf-recommended: no such file or directory`.

```caddy
{
    order coraza_waf first
}

example.com {
    coraza_waf {
        load_owasp_crs
        directives `
            Include @coraza.conf-recommended
            Include @crs-setup.conf.example
            Include @owasp_crs/*.conf
            SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly
        `
    }
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

Start at `SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly`, watch the logs for false positives, write your
exclusions, and only then switch to `On`. CRS in blocking mode will otherwise break
application admin panels — WordPress's `/wp-admin` in particular.

**Q: How do I rate limit login endpoints?**
A: `rate_limit` is ordered before `basic_auth` by default, so no `order` directive is
needed. Matchers go inside the zone's `match` block:

```caddy
example.com {
    rate_limit {
        zone login {
            match {
                path /wp-login.php /xmlrpc.php
            }
            key    {http.request.remote.host}
            events 5
            window 1m
        }
    }
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

`window` and `events` are both required. A key containing a placeholder allocates one
limiter per distinct value — here, per client IP. A static key (no placeholder) means one
limiter for the whole zone. `Retry-After` is set automatically on the 429.

**Q: How do I block AI crawlers?**
A: `defender` matches the client IP against embedded range lists, refreshed with the
module rather than fetched at runtime:

```caddy
example.com {
    defender block {
        ranges aws azurepubliccloud deepseek gcloud githubcopilot openai
    }
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

Those six are also the default if you omit `ranges`. Custom CIDRs can be listed alongside
the predefined keys. Responders: `block` (403), `drop`, `garbage`, `tarpit`, `custom`
(needs `message`), `redirect` (needs `url`), and `ratelimit`, which hands the request to
the rate limit module above rather than rejecting it outright.

Matching is by IP range, so this catches declared crawler infrastructure — not a scraper
that spoofs a user agent from a residential address.

**Q: Can I use this image with FrankenPHP?**
A: This is a standalone Caddy image. For a pre-configured Caddy+PHP setup, use the [morsalin1342/frankenphp](https://hub.docker.com/r/morsalin1342/frankenphp) image instead, which bundles this same Caddy plugin stack with PHP.
